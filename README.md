# Certified Partner Rancher Extensions

 

### 1. Definition:

 Rancher Extensions are designed to enhance and expand the
 functionality of Rancher, enabling partners to develop and integrate
 innovative features while ensuring seamless compatibility with the
 core platform. 

 The "Tested & Certified -- Rancher Extension" certification is part of
 the SUSE "Tested & Certified" product certification framework and it
 aims to address the growing need for a standardized, high-quality, and
 reliable ecosystem of [Rancher
 Extensions](https://rancher.github.io/dashboard/extensions/introduction)
 that augment the capabilities of the [Rancher by
 SUSE](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher) platform.
 This guide provides step-by-step instructions for [SUSE
 partners](https://www.suse.com/partners/) on how to
 certify their Rancher Extensions developed for use with Rancher. 

  

 The rationale behind the Rancher Extensions certification is to
 establish a set of guidelines, best practices, and validation
 processes that partners can follow to guarantee the quality,
 compatibility, and reliability of their Rancher Extensions. By
 adhering to the certification criteria, partners demonstrate their
 commitment to maintaining the high standards expected within the
 Rancher ecosystem. This certification process also encourages
 innovation and collaboration among partners, fostering a vibrant and
 growing ecosystem of Rancher Extensions that can cater to a wide range
 of use cases and customer needs. 

  

 Furthermore, the Rancher Extensions certification helps build trust
 and recognition among customers by providing a clear indication of
 which Rancher Extensions have been thoroughly vetted and endorsed by
 SUSE. This assurance allows customers to make more informed decisions
 when selecting Rancher Extensions to deploy in their Rancher
 environments.

### 4. Certification Workflow 


1.  <ins>Prepare for Certification:</ins> Complete the general and
           Rancher Extensions-specific certification prerequisites to ensure
           that the extension is ready for the certification process. 
      
      
     -  _Review Rancher Extension Guidelines:_ Thoroughly study the
                [official Rancher Extensions
                documentation](https://rancher.github.io/dashboard/extensions/introduction)
                and ensure that the extension adheres to the guidelines and best
                practices outlined, including proper use of Rancher APIs, UI
                components, and other platform-specific features. 
           
           
     -  _Integration Testing:_ Conduct integration testing to ensure the
                Rancher Extension works seamlessly with the core Rancher platform
                and other certified Rancher Extensions (where applicable) 
           
           
     -  _Security and Compliance:_ Ensure that the Rancher Extension
                complies with relevant security standards and guidelines,
                safeguarding customer data and maintaining the security of the
                overall Rancher environment. 
           
           
     -  _Performance and Scalability:_ Validate that the Rancher Extension
                performs efficiently and effectively under various workloads, and
                can scale as needed to support larger deployments. 
           
           
     -  _Extension Documentation:_ Prepare thorough documentation for the
                Rancher Extension, detailing installation, configuration, usage,
                and troubleshooting, as well as any Rancher-specific
                considerations. 
 
           
2.  <ins>Submit Request:</ins> Submit a certification request to
           SUSE, providing necessary details about the Rancher Extension,
           including documentation, compatibility information, and any other
           relevant materials. 
      
        
      
3.  <ins>Initial Review:</ins> SUSE will conduct an initial review of
           the submitted materials, evaluating the extension\'s adherence to
           guidelines, best practices, and compatibility with Rancher. SUSE
           may request additional information or clarifications at this
           stage. 
      
        
      
4.  <ins>Certification Testing:</ins> Upon passing the initial
           review, the Rancher Extension will undergo a series of
           certification tests by SUSE to validate functionality,
           compatibility, performance, security, and other relevant aspects. 
      
        
      
5.  <ins>Address Issues:</ins> If any issues are identified during
           the certification testing, partners must address these issues and
           resubmit the extension for retesting until it passes all the
           necessary certification tests. 
      
        
      
6.  <ins>Certification Approval:</ins> Once the Rancher Extension
           passes all certification tests, SUSE will grant the Rancher
           Extensions certification and provide the partner with a
           certification badge that can be displayed on their website,
           product materials, and other marketing collateral.  Your Rancher
           Extension certification will be also listed in the [SUSE Partner
           Certification and Solutions Catalog
           (PCSC)](https://www.suse.com/susePSC/home) 
      
        
      
7.  <ins>Continuous Maintenance:</ins> After receiving the
           certification, partners must continuously maintain and update
           their Rancher Extension to ensure ongoing compatibility with
           Rancher updates and compliance with the certification criteria. 
      
        
      
8.  <ins>Recertification:</ins> Partners may need to go through a
           recertification process if significant updates are made to the
           extension or if new versions of Rancher are released that may
           impact compatibility. SUSE will provide guidelines on when
           recertification is necessary.
